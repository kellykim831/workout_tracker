# Workout_Tracker

 ## Description 
 The Node Express Handlebars assignment was to create a burger application logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The MVC design pattern was followed and I needed to use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Process
  This was an extremely tedious process set up! The first step was to set up several folders. Here is the list: App Setup, DB Setup, Config Setup, Model Setup, Controller Setup and the View Setup. The next step is to install node and the dependencies were Express, Express handlebars and MySql. Please see below for some snippets:

 ## Installation
 You will need VS code and the dependencies are Express, Express-handlebars and MySql.
 
 ## Usage 
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the right side of the page, and the burgers listed on the left side are waiting to be devoured. Each burger either has a "Get in my Belly!" button or an "Eat it Again!" button along with a "Delete!" button. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
